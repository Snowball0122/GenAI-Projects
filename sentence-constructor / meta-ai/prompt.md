## Examples

Here are examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score becasue and why the example is scored the way it is.

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>8</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - Good: shows the correct contents
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
    Here's a vocabulary table to help you with the transcription:

    | Japanese	| Romaji	| English |
    | 熊	| kuma	| bear |
    | 門	| mon	| door, gate |
    | ごみ	| gomi	|garbage, trash |
    | 出す	| dasu	|to take out, to put out |

    Possible sentence structure:
    You might want to consider breaking it down into two sentences: "Bears are at the door" and "Did you leave the garbage out?"
    For the first part, think about how you'd describe a location in Japanese.
    For the second part, consider the verb tense and how to form a question.
    Give it a try! 😊
